In realms of light where shadows dance,     
The moon's soft glow, a tender trance.     
Stars above, like diamonds gleam,    
Illuminate the night's sweet dream.    

Through whispering woods and silent glen,    
The breeze sings softly, now and then.     
Echoes of tales, forgotten lore,    
Lost in time, forevermore.    

In meadows green where wildflowers bloom,    
Nature's palette, beauty's womb.    
A symphony of life's embrace,   
In every corner, every space.    

The river's flow, a gentle stream,   
Reflects the sky, a mirrored dream.   
Time stands still in this sacred place,   
Where harmony and peace embraces.
